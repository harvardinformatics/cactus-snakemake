# This pipeline uses the add to branch method to add a new genome to an existing HAL file.

# Below are the parameters you need to set for the cactus snakemake pipeline.
# YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THESE
#

cactus_path:
# Provide the path to the cactus singularity container. This is needed whether use_gpu is True or False.
# If you don't have it, set this to "download" and the pipeline will download it for you.
# If you want to download a specific version, provide the version tag, e.g. v2.9.7

cactus_gpu_path:
# If using GPUs (i.e. if use_gpu: True), provide the path to the cactus GPU singularity container. 
# If use_gpu is False, this will be ignored.
# If you don't have it, set this to "download" and the pipeline will download it for you.
# If you want to download a specific version, provide the version tag, e.g. v2.9.7

input_file: evolverMammals-update.txt
# File containing the genome to be added to the hal file.
# Tab delimited columns: genome name, genome file, branch length
# Only the first line will be used.
# See: https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/cactus-update-prepare.md#adding-genomes-examples

input_hal: evolverMammals-out/evolverMammals.hal
# The input HAL file. This is the output of a previous cactus run.

output_dir: evolverMammals-update-out/
# The output directory for the snakemake pipeline. This should be the same as the outDir in cactus-prepare.
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

parent_node: Anc1
# The node directly above the genome to be added in the tree.
# This is the node directly above a new branch which will be added to the tree.
# See: https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/updating-alignments.md

child_node: mr
# The node directly below the genome to be added in the tree.
# This is the node directly below a new branch which will be added to the tree.
# See: https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/updating-alignments.md

anc_name: AncGorilla
# The name of the new node that will be created in the tree.

orig_branch_length: 0.271974
# The original branch length connectiong child_node to parent_node.

top_branch_length: 0.10
# This specifies how the existing branch between child_node and parent_node will be split by the new node (anc_name).
# This is the length of the branch that will connect the new node to the existing parent_node.

overwrite_original_hal: False
# Whether or not to overwrite the original HAL file (True) or make a copy and use it (False).
# If a copy is made (False), you don't risk corrupting the original HAL file, but you will
# use twice as much disk space.

final_prefix: evolverMammals-update
# The prefix for the final output files. This will be used to name the final HAL file and the final MAF files.

maf_reference: simHuman_chr6
# The reference genome for the MAF files. This should be the name of the reference genome in the input_file.

tmp_dir: /n/holylfs05/LABS/informatics/Users/gthomas/tmp/evolverMammals/
# A temporary directory for snakemake and cactus to use. Should have lots of space.

use_gpu: False
# Whether or not to use the GPU version of cactus.
# If you don't have a GPU partition, set this to False.
# Either way, be sure to set the correct values for the partitions and GPUs below.

## Below are the partitions and resources for each rule in the snakemake pipeline.
## Be sure to adjust them to meet your needs and the resources available on your cluster.
## Notably, for rule blast, if you use the GPU version of cactus you will need to
## provide a partition with GPUs and set blast_gpu to the number of GPUs you want to use.
## If you are not using the cactus GPU version, the blast_gpu value will be ignored.
##
## The partitions are specific to the Harvard cluster. If you run this on a different cluster
## you must change them.
