# This config file is a necessary input file for the Cactus replace Snakemake
# pipeline: cactus_replace.smk. It contains the parameters needed to run the pipeline.

# This pipeline uses the replace method to replace a genome in an existing HAL file.

# Below are the parameters you need to set for the cactus snakemake pipeline.
# YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THESE
#

cactus_path:
# Provide the path to the cactus singularity container. This is needed whether use_gpu is True or False.
# If you don't have it, set this to "download" and the pipeline will download it for you.
# If you want to download a specific version, provide the version tag, e.g. v2.9.7

cactus_gpu_path:
# If using GPUs (i.e. if use_gpu: True), provide the path to the cactus GPU singularity container. 
# If use_gpu is False, this will be ignored.
# If you don't have it, set this to "download" and the pipeline will download it for you.
# If you want to download a specific version, provide the version tag, e.g. v2.9.7

input_hal: evolverMammals-out/evolverMammals.hal
# The input HAL file. This is the output of a previous cactus run.

replace: simHuman_chr6
# The genome in the input hal file to be replaced

new_genome_fasta: evolverMammals-seq/simGorilla.chr6
# The path to the genome file to be added to the HAL file.

output_dir: evolverMammals-replace-out/
# The output directory for the snakemake pipeline. This should be the same as the outDir in cactus-prepare.
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

overwrite_original_hal: False
# Whether or not to overwrite the original HAL file (True) or make a copy and use it (False).
# If a copy is made (False), you don't risk corrupting the original HAL file, but you will
# use twice as much disk space.

final_prefix: evolverMammals-replace
# The prefix for the final output files. This will be used to name the final HAL file and the final MAF files.

maf_reference: simHuman_chr6
# The desired reference genome for the MAF files.

tmp_dir: /n/holylfs05/LABS/informatics/Users/gthomas/tmp/evolverMammals/
# A temporary directory for snakemake and cactus to use. Should have lots of space.

use_gpu: False
# Whether or not to use the GPU version of cactus.
# If you don't have a GPU partition, set this to False.
# Either way, be sure to set the correct values for the partitions and GPUs below.

## Below are the partitions and resources for each rule in the snakemake pipeline.
## Be sure to adjust them to meet your needs and the resources available on your cluster.
## Notably, for rule blast, if you use the GPU version of cactus you will need to
## provide a partition with GPUs and set gpus to the number of GPUs you want to use.
## If you are not using the cactus GPU version, the gpus value will be ignored.
##
## The partitions are specific to the Harvard cluster. If you run this on a different cluster
## you must change them.

## mem_mb is in MB
## time is in minutes
