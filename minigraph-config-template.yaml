# Below are the parameters you need to set for the cactus-minigraph snakemake pipeline.
#

cactus_path: 
# File path or "download".
# Provide the path to the cactus singularity container. 
# If you don't have it, set this to "download" and the pipeline will download it for you.

input_file: 
# File path.
# File containing a list of sample IDs and genome files.

output_dir: 
# Directory path.
# The desired output directory for the snakemake pipeline. This directory will be created if it doesn't exist.
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

overwrite_output_dir: 
# True/False.
# This is a safety feature. If the output directory already exists, the pipeline will not run.
# If you are sure you want to overwrite the output directory, set this to True.

reference: 
# String
# The reference genome for the pangenome. This should be the name of one of the genomes in the input_file.

prefix: 
# String
# A prefix for the output files.

tmp_dir: 
# A temporary directory for snakemake and cactus to use. 
# Will be created if it doesn't exist, but it should be located somewhere with lots of space.

use_gpu: 
# True/False.
# Whether or not to use the GPU version of cactus.
# If you don't have a GPU partition, set this to False.
# Either way, be sure to set the correct values for the partitions and GPUs below.

## Below are the partitions and resources for each rule in the snakemake pipeline.
## Be sure to adjust them to meet your needs and the resources available on your cluster.
## Notably, for align, if you use the GPU version of cactus, you will need to
## provide a partition with GPUs and set the gpu values to the number of GPUs you want to use.
## If you are not using the cactus GPU version, the gpu values will be ignored.
